== 0.9.12

* Moved the whole pagination logic to the paginator partial so that users can
touch it
  Note: You need to update your _paginator.html.* if you've already customized
	it. If you haven't overridden _paginator.html.* files, then probably
	there're nothing you have to do.
	See this commit for the example:
		https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari_themes/commit/2dfb41c

== 0.9.10

* the per() method accepts String, zero and minus value now #7 [koic]

== 0.9.5

* works on AR 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 now #4 [danillos]

== 0.9.4

* introduced module based tags
  As a side effect of this internal change, I have to confess that this
  version brings you a slight backward incompatibility on template API.
  If you're using custom templates, be sure to update your existing templates.
  To catch up the new API, you need to update %w[next_url prev_url page_url]
  local variables to simple 'url' like this.
    https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari/commit/da88729

== 0.9.3

* improved template detection logic
  When a template for a tag could not be found in the app/views/kaminari/
  directory, it searches the tag's ancestor template files before falling back
  to engine's default template. This may help keeping your custom templates DRY.
